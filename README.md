The app would typically have a user interface where users can create new notes by entering a title 
and description. When the user saves a new note, the app would insert a new record into an SQLite 
database table, storing the note's title, description, and any other relevant metadata. To read or 
display existing notes, the app would query the SQLite database table and retrieve the note records, 
which can then be displayed in a list or individual note view. 
For updating notes, the user would be able to edit the title and description of an existing note. The 
app would then update the corresponding record in the SQLite database with the new values. 
To delete a note, the user would select a note and choose to delete it. The app would then remove 
the corresponding record from the SQLite database table. 
The app would interact with the SQLite database using SQL queries (INSERT, SELECT, 
UPDATE, DELETE) to perform the CRUD operations. SQLite is a lightweight, serverless 
database engine that can be embedded directly into the application, making it a popular choice for 
mobile and desktop apps that require local data storage. This is a high-level overview of how a 
notes app with CRUD functionality using SQLite might work, without going into specific 
implementation details or reproducing any copyrighted material.
